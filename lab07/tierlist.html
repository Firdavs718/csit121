<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>This tierlist as a mentioned above was from my own personal experience. During the making of this website I learned how to use table and how I can assign a class for it, so I can later style it in CSS and have more control over the table I have created. There were very few chalenges which thought me things like when to use "th" and "td", from my understanding "th" is used for the title if the table and "td" is used for the rest of the table. Overall I had fun doing this lab, and learned few new things.</p>
