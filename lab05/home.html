<h3>Lab 05</h3>
<em>Published on March 18, 2025 by Firdavs Islamov</em>
<p>In this lab I learned to separate my content in my webpage. During the making I made lots of mistakes but also learned from them. I now can use padding, margin, and other commands in CSS that will help me move around my content.</p>
