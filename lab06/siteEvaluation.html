<h1>Site evaluation</h1>

<p><strong>For my website evaluation I decided to choose Towson University.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><nav><a href= "https://www.towson.edu/">URL for Towson University</a> </nav></li>
<li>The name for the website is Towson University.</li>
<li>The target audience for the website is students who are looking to attend a university or who are planning to transfer.</li>
<li>This websites design is unique the reason I say  that's is because it got mix of <strong>Hierarchical and Random Organization.</strong></li>
<li>Audit Score according to Accessibility Checker is <strong>76%</strong> </li>
<li>The website is well organized, and yes it suports users in completing actions accurately. For example you can request a tour around the university and it easy and useful.</li>
<li>The website is also very efficient, everything in the website is simple and easy to understand, user firendly. </li>
<li>The website is very engaging it is filled with photos and useful information that will keep a user in a comfortable and engaging state.</li>
<li>My only recommendation would be to make the image in the home page smaller, in my opinion it is taking up a lot of space, other than that the website looks solid.</li>
</ul>
